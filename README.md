# Recursion Tree with Slider in Elm

This project implements a responsive recursion tree using the Elm programming language, featuring an interactive slider to control the depth of recursion. Elm is known for its strong type system and functional programming paradigm, making it well-suited for building reliable web applications.

## Key Features

- **Recursion Tree Visualization:** 
  The application visualizes a recursion tree, allowing users to understand recursive algorithms and data structures through an interactive graphical representation.

- **Responsive Design:** 
  The recursion tree adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience across various devices.

- **Interactive Slider:** 
  A slider is integrated into the interface, enabling users to adjust the depth of recursion dynamically. This feature provides a real-time view of how recursion unfolds at different levels.
